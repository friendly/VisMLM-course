#' Simpsonâ€™s Paradox is the phenomenon in which a trend observed between variables 
#' is reversed when data are pooled, omitting a meaningful variable.
#' This example examines the relation between bill length and bill depth in the
#' penguins data.
#' 
#' As will be seen, When penguin species is omitted, bill length and depth appear 
#' negatively correlated overall. The trend is reversed when species is included,
#' revealing an obviously positive correlation between bill length and bill depth within species.
#' 
#' The reason for the reversal is that the means of the three groups are negatively
#' correlated, inducing an overall negative relationship.
