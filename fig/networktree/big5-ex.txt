For each of the plots in this section, we present partial correlation networks,
which are found by taking an inversion of the covariance matrix in each of the
terminal nodes. We could also potentially examine the terminal nodes in terms of
the raw covariance matrices, correlation matrices, regularized partial
correlation networks, factor models, etc. Because the splits are based on the
covariance matrix, special caution should be taken when further estimation
procedures are applied to the terminal nodes (e.g., graphical lasso networks).

We selected data from the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; Gosling et al.
2003), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS; Brown et al. 1997), and
accompanying demographic information and validity checks.

First, we examined the TIPI data. The TIPI is a brief inventory of the Big Five
personality domains. Scores on each personality domain are calculated by
averaging items assigned to each domain (after reverse scoring specific items).
After removing individuals that failed validity checks, we were left with 1899
observations. Before applying MOB/CTree, we generated an overall partial
correlation network based on the full sample, given in Fig. 4. The resulting
structure suggests a negative relationship between neuroticism and
conscientiousness, a positive relationship between extraversion and openness to
experience, and several other potentially interesting relationships.
