Creating github.io pages for a course using kintr::render_site

I'm confused about the organization of files for a course built
using `knitr:render_site` and to be deployed on github
as `my_name.github.io/course_name`

* Github pages creates the web pages from the `docs/` directory, whereas
`render_site` places them in a `_site` directory.  Will it work if
I just use:

    output_dir = docs

in my `_site.yml` file?  Or is there a different way to do this?


My local project directory looks like this. 

+-- about.Rmd
+-- examples
+-- exercises
+-- fig
+-- footer.html
+-- images
+-- index.Rmd
+-- lectures
|   +-- lecture1.pdf
|   +-- lecture1.pptx
|   +-- lecture1.Rmd
|   +-- lecture2.pdf
|   +-- lecture2.pptx
|   +-- lecture3.pdf
|   \-- lecture3.pptx
++-- R
+-- resources.Rmd
+-- styles.css
+-- _site
+-- _site.yml
